If you want it, take it
I should have said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore (ooh)
I only want to die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart (ooh)
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more'echo
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more'

You were better, deeper
I was under your spell, yeah
Like a deadly fear, yeah, babe
On the highway to hell, yeah (ooh)
I only want to die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart (ooh)
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
